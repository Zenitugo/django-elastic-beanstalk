This project was done to improve my knowledge in utilising AWS offering to deploy applications.
The source code for the python application can be found here (https://github.com/SuryaPratap2542/Voting-Site)

**To see how to deploy django app on AWS Elastic Beanstalk using AWS CLI read this article I wrote on**
[Hashnode](https://dhebbydavid.hashnode.dev/deployment-of-a-django-application-on-aws-elasticbeanstalk-using-aws-cli)


The article has higlighted the pre-requisites to have, the only difference here is that `Terraform` was installed as this repository talks about using terraform to create Beanstalk infrastructure and the necessay resources required by Beanstalk such EC2 and S3 buckets
